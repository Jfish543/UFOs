# UFOs
# Purpose
The purpose of the website is to allow users to filter through UFO data using filters. It allows a user to search the data by 5 criteria (using one or all five search options).
# Results
The webpage initially loads the entire data table, with 5 search boxes on the left hand side.
To search the user enters a search criterion and presses enter. Once done, the table adjusts for the search results.
# Summary
The website performs its purpose, however, there are a few ways to improve it. A current challenge of the webpage is that once a search is performed and filtered, in order to return to the original table, you need to refresh the page.
I would add drop-down menus to the search criteria to help users when they don't know the exact name, place they want to search. In addition, I'd add a reset button that refreshes the page and clears the search criteria. Finally, I would add a map, that shows the location of all the UFO sightings, and allow the user to hover over the map points to see the associated data.
